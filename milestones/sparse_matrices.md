## Milestone: SPARSE_MATRICES

_This Milestone will allow you to understand how matrices can be stored in a sparse format_

- Describe what are sparse matrices
- Which packages provides sparse matrices?
- How can you create a sparse matrix?
- Read the matrix in file `Supp_file_1.csv` as a full matrix.
- How can you convert a full matrix to sparse notation (save to a different variable name).
- Look inside the sparse matrix object, what components constitute this matrix?
- What each sparse matrix component represent?
- Benchmark the amount of memory used (a.k.a. object size) for a full matrix and compare to a sparse matrix.
- What are the advantages of sparse matrices?
