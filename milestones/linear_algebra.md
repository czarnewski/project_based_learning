## Milestone: MATRIX_OPERATIONS

_This Milestone will allow you to start working with Vectors and matrices_

- Load the dataset `######.csv` as a matrix.
- What are the dimensions of this matrix?
- What each row and/or each column of this matrix represent?
- How can you find the sum of all values for each column? and for each row?
- How can you divide each column by its respective total column sum? (save this to another variable name)
  - Check that the sum of each column of the new matrix is 1
- How can you divide each row by its respective total row sum? (save this to another variable name)
  - Check that the sum of each row of the new matrix is 1
