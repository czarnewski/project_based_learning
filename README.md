# Project Based Learning
Author: [Paulo Czarnewski](https://czarnewski.github.io/czarnewski/index.html)

This is a repository for learning different topics using `project-based learning`.

***

TO KEEP IN MIND:

- Each millestone is divided to be completed within `1 hour` (more or less).
- Try to be efficient as possible, google for answers and don't overthink it.
- You can of course take your time later to "digest" the lessons learned.
- All millestones are designed using "active learning".
